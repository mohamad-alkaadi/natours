we want to log the users in 


when we have implemented signup before like this:

exports.signup = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
  const newUser = await User.create(req.body);

  res.status(201).json({
    status: 'success',
    data: {
      user: newUser,
    },
  });
});

what is wrong with this method is that we take the whole req.body to sign up the user, if user want to sign up as admin he can do so


the jsonwebtoken package include the signing and the verification
