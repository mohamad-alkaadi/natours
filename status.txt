we have completed the the first step of authentication 
we have logged the user in and the JSON web token is created and sent back to the client if the user provides a correct email and password

next step we will implement protected routes 
meaning we use the JSON web token to give the logged in users access to the protected route 

for example we want to protect the getAllTours controller
before running the route handler we want to check if the user is logged in or not 
and the best way of doing that is using a middleware function



a common practice is to send a token using an http header with the request


the standard way to do so is call it authentication header in the key

and in the value we start with: Bearer, then the value of the token

Bearer means we possess the token

ex: Bearer dsajkfjkhsajkdh24kjakdjsakj21kekja
