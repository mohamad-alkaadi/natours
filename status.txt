uncaught exceptions

all errors that occur in our synchronous code but not handled anywhere are called uncaught exceptions
so we need to handle them

for example if we are trying to log a variable that is not defined, it will throw an uncaught exception

we do it just like unhandled rejections

in unhandled rejections shutting down our application is optional

but in uncaught exceptions, it is required because the after we have an uncaught exception the entire node process is in a "unclean state"
so we need to shut it down to prevent any further damage and then restarted

we should put this event listener on the top of the server efore usig the node application
